# interactive_3d_particles_with_hands

This complete solution uses Three.js for 3D rendering and MediaPipe Hands for real-time gesture tracking.

The system maps "Hand Tension" (the distance between your thumb and index finger) to the expansion of the particles and the "Closed Hand" gesture to the shrinking/scaling.

How to use:
Copy the code below into an .html file (e.g., hand-particles.html).
Open it in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge recommended).
Grant camera permissions.
Gestures: Open/Close your hand to scale. Move your hand to move the particles. Pinch your thumb and index to "tense" and expand the particles.
